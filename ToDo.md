To Do
===

##30/09/14

* Replicate the graphs in the Haeno paper by changing our current program to check for the probability of fixation rather than running it until the population is entirely type 2. 
* Learn the determistic analyis of the fixed points for the 2 mutation model. 
* Implement extra mutation types. 



##07/10/14 

* Generate a gif of the 100 mutations. 
* Refactor the code.
* Take the transmission equations and Euler forward them.
* Look at the means, variances (count bins), spread. I.e. statistical tests.  

* Vary r1, vary N. 

##21/10/14

* More species in the simulations to check the linearity of the averages and velocity.
* Change mutation rates (Matt).
* Change fitness landscapes (Dean).
* Derive the PDE. (Thursday)

##11/11/14

*Solve our Fokker Planck with Fourier transform. 
*Check the master equation Poissoinian. 
*Plot the Fourier solution for different Delta x's. 

##25/11/14

* Work out why the Fourier solution and simulation don't line up. Possible scaling of axis  
* Discretize Fourier transform solve equation. 
* 
##04/02/15

* Sort out the delta x's
* Numerically solve our new PDE
* Simulate for simple cases of u(x) (Means adding in functions with simulation). 
* Analyse what the potential should be looking like and physical reasons.
* Look up non constant coeffcient PDE's somewhere.
